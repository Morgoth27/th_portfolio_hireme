Tiffany H - This is a portfolio of my works! Though I do not have any at this point, with the exception of a small student project we worked on at the beginning of class.

The website features links to a small portfolio, and displays my contact information. The formatting is designed around my black cat, Morgoth.

I am sure there is some redundant or over-complicated code, but in fear of breaking everything, I will remove it a later time. Once I understand how things work a little bit better.

I commented in the stylesheet in the areas where I was not sure it was very obvious what the code was doing. The rest is pretty straightforward formatting stuff, trying to get elements to sit where I want on the page.

Thanks for reading!
